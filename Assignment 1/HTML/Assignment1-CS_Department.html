              <h3>Welcome to the Department of Computer Science at George Mason University!</h3>
                <p>With nearly 70 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the College of Engineering and Computing,
                one of the largest departments on campus, and the largest and fastest growing CS department in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
                <p>Today, not only is computing pervasive in society, but computational methods are used in almost every field of scholarly endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and engineering,
                     as well as every sector of industry. Given the importance of computing in today's world, we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All",
                      providing a diverse array of programs and courses in computing to students from all backgrounds and at all levels.</p>
                <p>The department offers two Bachelor of Science programs  with a total enrollment of over 2000 students:  the B.S. in Computer Science and the inter-disciplinary B.S. in Applied Computer Science; four M.S. programs in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering with a total enrollment of 500 students; and a Ph.D. program in Computer Science with nearly 150 students.
                     The department's faculty also teach and participate in the inter-disciplinary M.S. in Data Analytics Engineering and the Ph.D.
                      in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau School of Engineering.</p>
                <p>The department has a world-class faculty with research strengths in all areas of computing, and a strong commitment to teaching, and we rank among the Top 50 Computer Science Departments in the US.
                      Our faculty are engaged in leading edge research in their respective fields and have authored widely used textbooks and software. Our faculty's excellence is reflected in the list of awards received for research (20 NSF CAREER and AFOSR Young Investigator awards,
                       7 Mason Emerging Researcher awards) and teaching (8 Mason Excellence in Teaching awards), and our faculty include three ACM Fellows and four IEEE Fellows.</p>            
                <p>Several members of the department's faculty are actively engaged in inter-disciplinary research collaborations with colleagues from all over campus and other universities. 
                    Indeed inter-disciplinary collaboration in research and education is a key component of our departmental vision and strategic direction for the future.</p>

        <p>The Department also offers additional graduate certificates in a variety of topics; course work toward the certificates can be used for credit toward various Masters programs.</p>
        <p>Graduate classes are offered in the late afternoon and evening to accommodate the professionally employed students. The MS in Computer Science program is now offered with the option of a 100% online format.  Financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships may be available for full- time degree-seeking students. Appropriate courses may be transferred, with advisor approval, into the degree program.</p>
        <p>Undergraduate students in CS or IT at George Mason University may also enroll in a Bachelor's/Accelerated Master's Program as part of their BS degree. </p>

    <p>The Computer Science graduate program prepares students for research and professional practice in computer science and related technologies. The program includes both fundamentals and advanced work in the areas of artificial intelligence and databases, programming languages and software engineering, systems and networks, theoretical computer science, and visual computing. Graduate classes are divided into basic classes, which have no graduate course prerequisite, and advanced classes, which have a graduate class as a prerequisite. Graduate classes are generally offered in the late afternoon and evening.
        Financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships may be available for full-time degree-seeking students.</p>
